        <h2>Challenges in Basketball Shot Analysis</h2>
        <hr style="border: 4px solid #000; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                <strong>Object Detection Accuracy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Description: Detecting the basketball can be quite challenging due to various factors such as changing lighting conditions and complex backgrounds. The detection system must consistently recognize the ball under different circumstances, which can be particularly difficult in dynamic environments like a basketball game.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Example: For instance, if the gym has bright overhead lights or if the ball's color is similar to that of the court, it can confuse the detection algorithms. Moreover, during fast-paced plays, when the ball moves quickly, it may appear blurry in the recorded footage, leading to inaccuracies in detection. This becomes critical during moments when a player takes a quick shot, as the system might miss identifying the ball, impacting the overall analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                <strong>Tracking Reliability</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Description: Consistently tracking the basketball is essential, but several challenges can hinder this process. Tracking systems may struggle when the basketball becomes occluded or blocked from view by players or other objects on the court, resulting in gaps in the tracking data.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Example: For instance, if a player jumps to block a shot, the ball may go behind the player, making it difficult for the tracking system to maintain a reliable connection to the ball's location. Similarly, if the ball bounces off the rim or is passed quickly between players, tracking algorithms might lose sight of it. These challenges can be especially problematic during critical game situations when every shot counts, and accurate tracking is crucial for performance analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                <strong>Data Processing Speed</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Description: Real-time shot analysis relies heavily on the speed of data processing. Fast processing speeds are crucial to ensure that players and coaches receive immediate feedback on shooting techniques, allowing for timely adjustments. However, achieving this speed can be challenging, especially on mobile devices with limited processing power.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Example: If the analysis system takes too long to process the shot data, the feedback may arrive after the action has already taken place, diminishing its usefulness. For example, if a player receives insights about their shooting technique after they've already taken several shots, they miss the opportunity to adjust their approach in real-time, reducing the effectiveness of the analysis in improving their performance during the game.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                <strong>External Disturbances</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Description: External factors such as changing lighting conditions, ambient noise from the crowd, and unexpected player movements can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the shot analysis. These disturbances can interfere with the detection and tracking processes, leading to errors in the data collected.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin: 20px 0; list-style-type: none;">
                        Example: For example, during outdoor games, fluctuating sunlight can create shadows on the court, complicating the tracking of the ball. Similarly, the noise level from the crowd can distract both players and the tracking systems, potentially resulting in missed detections or inaccurate analyses. In environments where numerous players are moving rapidly, distinguishing the basketball from the surrounding activity becomes increasingly difficult, thereby impacting the quality of the analysis.
